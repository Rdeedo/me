            <h2>Reasons for Taking This Course</h2>
            <p>I took this course because Software Engineering is essential for a computer science degree, even if I don't plan on doing anything related to it. It will be nice to have the knowledge for future job opportunities.</p>

		<section class="job">
            <p>Current/Recent Job</p>
			<p>My most recent job was at a place called Code Ninjas, where I would help younger kids learn how to code. I would be there to help guide them through different coding assignments ranging in difficulty from simple javascript to C# in Unity. The one that I worked at shut down and I have not had a job since.</p>
